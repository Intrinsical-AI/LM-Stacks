# Multi-LLM Development as Team Negotiation with Consensus Agreements

Working with different LLM models is not fundamentally different from working with human teammates:  
**Each one has a unique perspective**, stemming (for LLMs) from different architectures, training data, cultural/technical biases, and reasoning paths.  
Even with `temperature=0`, non-deterministic GPU execution and model parallelism mean that you may not get *exactly* the same answer twice.

## Human Teams vs LLM Teams

- **With colleagues:**  
  You discuss, negotiate, and reach agreement. Decisions are based on logic, coherence, shared knowledge, and constraints.

- **With LLMs:**  
  The process is analogous, but you orchestrate the conversation (and always take the critical/final decisions, ideally based on the arguments on each one and the discusses nuances).

---

## LLM Negotiation Workflow

1. **Define the problem:** State your goals, constraints, and context.
2. **Share your struggles:** Write a clear message explaining where you are stuck and why.
3. **Parallel brainstorming:**  
    - Ask each LLM for feedback, encouraging creative and critical thinking.
    - Request a structured (e.g., JSON) response.
4. **Synthesize responses:**  
    - Summarize all LLM responses in a unified table or structure (one entry per model).
5. **Adversarial review:**  
    - Ask each LLM to critically review (and challenge) the *other models’* feedback.
    - Encourage detailed reasoning and identification of flaws or missing points.
6. **Consensus filtering:**  
    - Select statements and insights that are supported by multiple models and/or pass your critical filter.
7. **Second voting round:**  
    - Pass the updated summary, adversarial critiques, and current agreements back to each LLM.
    - Ask them to “vote” or rank unresolved ideas.
8. **Finalize decision:**  
    - Adopt the best-supported, most coherent solution.

## Notes

- **Costs and complexity:**  
  - This approach requires many LLM calls and careful context management.
  - *Pro tip*: Ask models to respond in JSON so you can automate voting/selection.

## Example

### Problem
> _"Design a secure user authentication API that balances user experience and protection against brute-force attacks."_

### Prompt Structure (to each model)

```python
problem = {
    "goals": [
        "Allow legitimate users to log in quickly.",
        "Prevent brute-force and automated attacks.",
        "Minimize false positives for real users."
    ],
    "constraints": [
        "No CAPTCHAs.",
        "No SMS or phone-based 2FA."
    ],
    "context": "Web app in Python (FastAPI), with Postgres backend.",
    "where_I_am_stuck": (
        "How to balance fast login for real users and aggressive rate-limiting "
        "without harming legitimate access? What would you suggest? Please justify your reasoning."
    )
}
```

### Expected LLM Response (JSON Example)

```json
{
    "model": "gpt-4o",
    "idea": "Implement adaptive rate-limiting using IP + user agent + historical user behavior patterns. Lock out on unusual patterns.",
    "rationale": "Adaptive approaches allow most real users to log in without friction, while raising cost for attackers.",
    "threats": [
        "IP spoofing, VPN abuse, shared networks."
    ]
}
```

### Orchestration Steps

1. **Collect responses** from each LLM in JSON.
2. **Summarize** all models’ proposals in a table.
3. **Ask each model to critique the others** (“Read these proposals. What would you improve? What do you disagree with?”)
4. **Aggregate the feedback**, filter for consensus or strongest arguments.
5. **Second round**: Pass the revised summary, unresolved items, and critiques to the models. Ask them to “vote” or propose a ranked solution.

## Potential Benefits

* Exposes hidden flaws by leveraging different reasoning paths.
* Reduces single-model bias.
* Provides more robust, “team-vetted” solutions.

---

## Potential Drawbacks

* Increased cost and latency (multiple LLM calls).
* Complexity in prompt and context management.
* Requires orchestration logic (Python scripts or a tool like LangChain, FastAPI, or custom pipelines).

## Sample Python (Pseudo-Orchestration)

```python
import openai  # or openrouter SDK

def ask_llms(models, prompt):
    responses = {}
    for model in models:
        responses[model] = call_model(model, prompt)  # your call_model logic here
    return responses

def summarize_responses(responses):
    for model, resp in responses.items():
        print(f"{model}: {resp['idea']} — {resp['rationale']}")

# ...adversarial review and consensus logic as previously described
```
