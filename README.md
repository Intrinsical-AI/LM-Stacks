## 🚀 Getting started

1. Clone the repo and create a Python virtual environment (optional, but usefull in general if you haven’t try it already)
2. Explore the folders above to find ready-to-use templates, stacks, or techniques relevant to your project.
3. Contribute back! Feel free to open pull-requests with new templates, methodologies, or improvements.

## 📚 What you will find here

* **Prompting templates** – reusable prompt skeletons designed for chats, code generation, and evaluation.
* **Techniques** – step-by-step guides that explain how to combine LLMs and humans effectively (TDD, Multi-Agent, Live-RAG …).
* **Stacks** – opinionated selections of libraries and tools for tasks such as data analysis, RAG, or UI prototyping.

## 🗺️ Roadmap

- Add unit & integration test examples for each technique.
- Expand the `stacks` section with containerised starter projects.
- Provide reference implementations for automated evaluation pipelines.
