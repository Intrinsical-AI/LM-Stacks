# Agents & Model Skills â€” Non-Systematic Review

A subjective assessment based on hands-on use of several leading models.

| Model | Strengths | Weaknesses | Ideal Use Cases |
|-------|-----------|------------|-----------------|
| **o3** | Complex problem solving, optimisation, long-term planning | Slower execution | Large-scale planning and optimisation |
| **4o** | Extremely fast; reliable for small tasks | Short context window | Small scripts and fast iteration |
| **Gemini-2.5** | Clear code explanations and rationale | Slight lag in supporting the latest libraries | Code reviews and documentation |
| **DeepSeek** | Systematic, robust reasoning | Slow | Adversarial validation and critical reviews |
| **Qwen** | Brainstorming, robustness | Less systematic than DeepSeek | Idea generation and prototyping |
| **Claude** | Natural language, writing, general knowledge | Short context window; expensive | Documentation and whitepapers |
