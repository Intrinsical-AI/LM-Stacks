# Machine Learning

- **SOTA**  
  In-depth exploration: instant comparison of different approaches in academia and industry (public at least), with pros and cons. Excellent critique for ideas and guidance in brainstorming.  
- **Code**  
  Web search for the most appropriate libraries (with pros and cons) and existing related works. Saves a lot of time if you put in effort before jumping into crazy coding.  
- **Out-of-the-box**  
  Integrations of simple neural networks (and more complex ones) for proof of concept on small datasets before scaling. Can provide hints before you develop a full repository for your experiments or research papers.  

> **Note:** For all research, summarization, exploration, and discovery, mix GPT-3 (very good at internet browsing) with DeepResearch (OpenAI, Google Gemini “User” main page, not AIStudio). Another idea is to pre-filter the papers you’re interested in and feed them into NotebookLM, which has excellent highlighting features.
