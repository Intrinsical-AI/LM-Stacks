# User Interfaces & Product Delivery

- **Python + Tkinter** *(tested)*  
  Quick prototyping, local PoCs, internal tools.
- **Python Backend (FastAPI) + Web UI (TypeScript/JavaScript/Node)**  - My recommendation it's start with v0 - a good advances LM oriented to Next.js - and then migrate to an advanced IDE (Windsurf, Cursor, Replit..) -  *(self tested – gave some headaches but positive overall)* - Suitable for user-facing products and medium/long-term projects.
- **Python + pygame** 
  Good for gamified PoCs, but requires continuous bug-fixing. - *(tested – quickly abandoned in favor of Tkinter for the same use cases)*
