# User Interfaces & Product Delivery

- **Python + Tkinter** *(tested)*  
  Quick prototyping, local PoCs, internal tools.
- **Python Backend (FastAPI) + Web UI (Next.js)** *(tested – some headaches but positive overall)*  
  Suitable for user-facing products and medium/long-term projects.
- **Python + pygame** *(tested – quickly abandoned in favor of Tkinter)*  
  Good for gamified PoCs, but requires continuous bug-fixing.
