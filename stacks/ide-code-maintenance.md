# Code Development And Manteinance

## IDEs & Local Environments

- **Windsurf**: multi-model, LLM-friendly IDE  
- **Cursor**  
- **Replit**  
- **Jupyter, VSCode, PyCharm** (as fallback options)


## Code Review & Maintainability Tools

- **Google Jules** – Async agent; useful for repo status reviews, brainstorming, and small fixes.
- **Codex** – Good for semi-hard fixes and medium-sized features.  
  - Parallelizable: N agents create N PRs, each with its own code view—ideal for tasks involving multiple modules.
- **Google Firebase** [Less Powerfull by now - Seems good for prototyping and deploying - not exahustively Tested yet]
